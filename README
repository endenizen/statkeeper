We have a ping pong table at work and some folks that like to talk a
big game.  This was hacked up in a couple of nights in order to keep
a record of the fierce office competition we have going.  The code
can support more than the one sport (if, god willing we get a foosball
table as well).

This was meant to be quick and dirty... it should show.

To get it going, just make sure Django is in your python path, run the
"refresh" script to set things up and "./manage.py runserver" to run
the local server.  Run the "refresh" script again whenever you want to
clear things out and start over.

From there, going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ should get you to the local
instance and http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ should get you to the local admin.
