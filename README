We have a ping pong table at work and some folks that like to talk a
big game.  This was hacked up in a couple of nights in order to keep
a record of the fierce office competition we have going.  The code
can support more than the one sport (if, god willing we get a foosball
table as well).

This was meant to be quick and dirty... it should show.
